    <h1>This is a page about me, Frank Riggio</h1>
    <p>My name is Frank Riggio, and I am a senior here at Missouri State pursuing my IT-Infrastructure degree. 
        As someone who was born into the digital age, one of my favorite hobbies and pastimes is playing video games. <br>
        I have been playing video games since I was around four years old, so it has been a passion of mine for pretty much my entire life.
        My favorite systems to play video games on include the Xbox One, the Nintendo Switch, <br> and the PC,
        though I am currently saving up for a new PC for a better gaming experience. My favorite video games tend to be competitive multiplayer shooters  
        such as Call of Duty, Halo, <br> and Battlefield. However, currently my favorite vdieo game to play is a game called Rocket League, which is essentially <br>
        a fast paced, hyper-competitive soccer game in which the players are actually cars that can fly through the air.
