        <h1>My Hobby: Attending Concerts</h1>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies involves seeing live music performances, or concerts. 
           I have been going to concerts with friends and family <br> since I was around 14 years old, and I have seen about ten different bands perform.
           Some of the bands I've seen perform include Blink 182, <br> Third Eye Blind, Kiss, Motley Crue, A Day to Remember, Wage War, and Slayer. 
           My favorite band to see perform is A Day to Remember, <br> and I have seen them perform four times in my home town of Saint Louis.
           With the COVID-19 pandemic retrictions being lessened and concert <br> venues opening up once more, I am looking forward to seeing
           my favorite rap group $uicideboy$ perform in Saint Louis for the first time in their <br> careers on October 19th.
           While I enjoy almost all types of music, my favorite types of music to hear live include rock, alternative, metal, blues, and rap.
